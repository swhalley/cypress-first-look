# Overview

Testing out some of the capabilities of [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

Simple create-react-app with a clickable button for some functionality. Nothing fancy but the testing looks at assertions, commands, actions and configuration.

# What to look at

`for_great_justice/` folder contains the test files

`cypress.json` configurations that were overwritten

`a_lesser_known_evil` extra files that cypress gave the project. only change is commands.js

# Usage

`npm install` to get the dependencies

`npm start` to start the dev server

`npm run cypress` start the test runner

In the app that opens, click the test you want to run or click to run all.
